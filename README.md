# ITAPI (06/11/23)
This is my second API created using the Django rest framework. This project is based on programming paradigms
Since 02/11/2023 I've been learning Python and the DJango Web Framework. Four months later and I have a decent understanding about creating a very basic CRUD app now I am learning how to create my own API. This is my second API which I am working on. It is very basic but over time I will improve my development skill in Django.
END GOAL: I am focused on Django for the purpose of calling and creating API's for my Android Application which I am learning at the present moment with Kotlin.
This project taught me about importing the djangorestframework.
This project has taught me about understanding and creating the serializers.py file and how to create your class for this file.
